I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in mathematics at Rutgers University--New Brunswick. 
I am interested in probability theory and statistical physics. 
My advisors are [Ian Jauslin](http://ian.jauslin.org) and [Joel Lebowitz](https://cmsr.rutgers.edu/people-cmsr/joel-lebowitz).

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
